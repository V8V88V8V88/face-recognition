# Face Recognition Using C, C++, Python 

This repository contains a C-based program for face detection and recognition using OpenCV and the dlib library. The program utilizes the dlib frontal face detector and shape predictor for face detection and implements face recognition using OpenCV's LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm.
Features:

    Detects faces in real-time using a webcam or video feed.
    Recognizes known faces based on pre-loaded images and labels them with confidence.

Requirements:

    OpenCV
    dlib
    shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file (for face detection)

Usage:

    Ensure the required libraries are installed.
    Place the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file in the project directory.
    Replace the placeholder face images (known_face_1.jpg, known_face_2.jpg) with your own known face images.
    Build and run the C program.

Feel free to contribute and improve the functionality!
