## Overview

This project leverages various face detection and recognition techniques to identify individuals from images or video streams. The core of the project is powered by pretrained models like `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat` for face recognition and `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel` for face detection.

The project provides scripts for:
- Detecting faces from images and videos.
- Recognizing faces by comparing them to a known dataset.
- Real-time face detection in live camera feeds.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Identify human faces in static images or videos.
- **Face Recognition:** Compare detected faces to a database of known faces.
- **Model Integration:** Pretrained models for accurate face detection and recognition.
- **Video Support:** Face detection from video files and live streams.
- **Easy Customization:** Easily extendable to add new models or adapt to custom datasets.

## Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- CMake (for building dlib)
- numpy

For Python dependencies, refer to the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/face-recognition.git
   cd face-recognition
   ```

2. **Install required Python libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up dlib** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install dlib
   ```

4. **Download Pretrained Models:**

   Ensure the required models are present in the `models/` directory:
   - [dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat](https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models)
   - [res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/dnn/face_detector/deploy.prototxt)

## Usage

### 1. Detect Faces from an Image

Use the `face1.py` script to detect faces in an image:

```bash
python src/face1.py --input ./data/faces/aman.jpg
```

### 2. Real-Time Face Recognition with Webcam

You can run real-time face recognition using a webcam by running:

```bash
python src/video1.py
```

### 3. Detect Faces from a Video

Use the `video1.py` script to detect faces from a video file:

```bash
python src/video1.py --input ./tests/test.mp4
```

### 4. Run the C++ Face Detection / Recognition (Live Webcam):

This program uses the models and known faces from `data/faces/` to perform real-time recognition using your webcam.

**Note:** Ensure you have the OpenCV development libraries installed (e.g., `opencv-devel` on Fedora/CentOS, `libopencv-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).

```bash
# Compile (if needed, run from project root)
# Adjust the -I path if OpenCV headers are installed elsewhere. Add -lstdc++fs if needed for <filesystem>.
g++ src/FaceDetection.cpp -o bin/FaceDetectionLite -I/usr/include/opencv4 -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_dnn -lopencv_face -lopencv_videoio -lopencv_imgcodecs -lstdc++fs

# Run (from project root)
./bin/FaceDetectionLite
```

## Models

### Pretrained Models

- **Face Recognition Model**: `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat`
- **Face Detection Model**: `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel`
- **Haar Cascade Model**: `lbpcascade_frontalface.xml`

### Model Download

If you do not have the models, you can download them from the following sources:
- [Dlib Face Recognition Model](https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models)
- [OpenCV Face Detection Model](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)

## Tests

Test images and videos are provided in the `tests/` folder. You can use them to verify the accuracy of the face detection and recognition scripts.

### Run Test Script

Run the Python test script:

```bash
python src/face2.py --input ./tests/test.png
```
